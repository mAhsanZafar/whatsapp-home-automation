## Wiring Diagram
1. **ESP8266 to Relay Module:**
   - Connect **D5** to **IN1** (controls LED 1)
   - Connect **D6** to **IN2** (controls LED 2)
   - Connect **D7** to **IN3** (controls Fan 1)
   - Connect **D8** to **IN4** (controls Fan 2)
   - Connect **GND** of ESP8266 to **GND** of Relay Module
   - Connect **3.3V** of ESP8266 to **VCC** of Relay Module

2. **Relay Module to Appliances:**
   - Each relay acts as a switch for the connected appliance (LEDs or Fans)
   - Connect **COM (Common)** to the **Live (L) wire** of AC supply
   - Connect **NO (Normally Open)** to one terminal of the appliance
   - The other terminal of the appliance should be connected to **Neutral (N)** of AC supply

## Powering the ESP8266
- Use a **5V power adapter** to supply power to ESP8266 via **Micro-USB or Vin & GND**
- Ensure proper isolation between **ESP8266 (low voltage side)** and **AC appliances (high voltage side)**

**âš  Safety Precautions:**
- Always turn off the power before wiring AC appliances.
- Use a proper **relay module** that can handle the current and voltage rating of your appliances.
- Keep ESP8266 and low-voltage components isolated from the AC wiring to prevent electrical hazards.
